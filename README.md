Project presentation.

Coming from different backgrounds, this team is made of 5 young developers. We wanted to share with you their passions
for Super Heroes and collectible card games. Those passions are the reason why they have created this site for you, with
your favorite Super Heroes, in the form of a collectible card.

Under development, this site will regularly have new cards added with new super heroes so stay tuned.

You will find their contact details at the bottom of this page. Feel free to contact them and consult the other
projects they are currently working on. We wish you a lovely visit on our website and as a wise man said :

                                        “May the force be with you”.
